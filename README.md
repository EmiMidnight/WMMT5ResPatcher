# WMMT5 Resolution Patcher
Special thanks to jackfuste from wsgf.org for the 2D\UI offsets\values.

## Changelog:

v1.02
- Added a check for Update 5 exe (so people will stop trying to patch 1.0 WMMT5)

v1.01
- Fixed some resolutions incorrect UI size
- Fixed FOV issue if patching from 21:9 to 16:9
- Added 21:9 variant of 2560x1440 and 5120x2880 (your monitor\gpu may or may not supports this, works fine on my RX480 + LG 29UM68-P), if your monitor\gpu can handle it, 
you will have stretched HUD\Menu, but they will be at correct places like in other 16:9 resolution.
- Added 1920x1080 with 21:9 (2560x1080) FOV in case you can't use the 2 other resolutions above, set your monitor to stretch so you will have fullscreen with stretched HUD\Menu,
but correct 3D.

## Known Issue(s):

- 21:9 resolutions UI isn't scaled properly (https://i.imgur.com/7dtUAR6.jpg), but if you play in "bumper" view, its actually not bad https://i.imgur.com/UE5JlZ8.jpg
- Very low resolutions can have issues (movie isn't scaled, minor text issues)
- Movies are not scaled properly
- Rival indicator is kinda incorrect
